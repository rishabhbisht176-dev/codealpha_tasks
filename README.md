# Hangman Game 🎮  

A simple *Hangman game* built in Python as part of my internship tasks.  
The player has to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before running out of attempts.  

---

## Features ✨
- Randomly selects a word from a list.  
- Displays the word with blanks _ for unguessed letters.  
- Tracks wrong guesses and remaining attempts.  
- Ends with a win 🎉 if the word is guessed, or a loss ❌ if attempts run out.  

---

## How to Run 🚀
1. Make sure you have *Python 3* installed.  
2. Save the code as hangman.py.  
3. Run it in terminal or IDLE:  

```bash
python hangman.py
